# Mantis Bug Tracker (BT) v1.3-custom

A case study on Free and Open Source Softwares (FOSS) as part of my third semester (second year) of Master Of Computer Applications (MCA).

It uses PHP as front end and MySQL for back end storage.

It contains a little customization done when exploring this system.

Note: This has no affiliation with the actual system whatsoever.
